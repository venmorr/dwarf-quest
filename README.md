Take on the role of a weary old dwarf who wants nothing more than to come home, kick off his boots, put on some tea, and pet his beloved cat MÃ©owyn. I made this game because I love storytelling and world-building. I also love puzzles, so this game was a really fun project to work on.

##Hightlights:  

A cool function I put together was this random sound function that I am pretty pround of

```js
function playSwordAudio() {
  //pic rand num 0-2
  let randNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2)
  //hold array of functions
  let sounds = [playSwordAudioII, playSwordAudioIII, playSwordAudioIV]
  //call function from array === randNum
  sounds[randNum]()
}
```
